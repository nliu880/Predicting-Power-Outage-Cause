    "This project will focus on the same dataset used in Project 3, and will aim to use prediction models to solve some form of prediction problem. The problem I have chosen to focus on in this report is predicting the cause of a power outage based on other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use a multiclass classification model to try and solve this prediction problem. The response variable will be `cause category`; this variable describes the general cause (ex. severe weather or intentional attack) of some power outage, which is what I am trying to predict. My evaluation metric will be the F-1 score. I want to balance both precision and recall. Accuracy in this case could also be used, but from my previous EDA in Project 3, I discovered there were large outliers that skewed the data. We want to avoid this in our metric, so we will use the F-1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin this by performing the same data cleaning steps as from Project 3. The code used to clean the data below is from there and condensed into one cell. I have made a few edits that involves adding the time unit to the `outage duration` columns. One is in minutes (the original) and ones is in hours (which I added in for clarity and intuition). I have also dropped the `cause category detail`, `hurricane name`, and `postal code` columns. In addition, we also fill in the missing values for certain columns by imputing either the mean or the mode of the group when grouped by `cause category`."
